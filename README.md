# React-Django Admin

## TODO: this is the backend service only :) adding the initial frontend app is in the making.

Administration interface in React JS. Using Django's Rest Framework for the backend, and bootstrap for the templates.

This is not meant to be a replacement of Django's admin. What this project is actually good for:

* You can provide a separate "administration" area for the website's users
* Gated web login for any OAuth2-based API


## Backend

To install the project:

```sh
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
$ python manage.py syncdb
```

Run locally:

```sh
$ foremen start
```

alternatively:

```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
```
